## Text-to-speech (TTS)

Text-to-speech is implemented using the Android system TTS engine via Termux:API (termux-tts-speak).

Characteristics:
- Fully offline (on-device Android TTS)
- No cloud services or API keys
- Very low latency
- Suitable for smart-home assistant responses

This is the most reliable lightweight TTS approach on modern Android + Termux.
